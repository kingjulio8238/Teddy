Hug me.
You’re my best friend, John.
Uh-huh.
Don’t look so surprised. You’re the one who wished for it, aren’t you?
Well, here I am.
For real.
Sounds good to me.
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Let’s all be best friends!
Is it a hugging gun?
I’m sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn’t mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends.
Nope. We’re thunder buddies. And the thunder knows it. We’re totally safe.
Yeah, John?
I promise.
Thunder buddies for life.
All I’m sayin’ is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life.
Lori’s from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl.
The fact that you have to say they’re not that bad means that they are that bad. They turn into drunk, half-white, half-pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach.
Jesus, this is weak. It’s not even gettin’ me high. I gotta have a talk with my weed guy.
I think it sucks, I’m gonna have a talk with him.
No, I know this guy a long time. I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, “Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high.”
Hey, you mind pickin’ up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds.
I’ll drive you, I feel fine.
Aw, Jesus. / Fuck.
Is it bad?
It’s okay, go, go, I’ll pull outta here.
Hi, Thomas! How are ya?
Easy, Jersey license!
Yes, a study in contrasts.
STAND FOR EVERY ONE OF US!
Fuck yeah, Flash!
Hey, before I forget, let’s nail down a plan for the Bruins game tomorrow night.
For what?
Oh, fuck me. Nice.
What, like anal?
Oh, fuck that! It’s four years! You and I have been together 27 years!
Where’s my ring, Johnny? Where’s my ring, asshole?
No, John. It’s a bad idea. And it’s the wrong time. What with the economy and... the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
Tom Brady could do that.
Hey, Lori.
Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something?
Whoa!!!
She’s funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette.
Hey Johnny, while you’re up, grab me a beer, huh?
Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now.
Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski?
Ohhhh, that doesn’t work!/Come on, don’t ruin it, yeah, that doesn’t work.
No, it’s gotta have a “ski” at the end. Otherwise where’s the challenge? If there’s no “ski” at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense.
Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny? C’mon, let’s sing the thunder song!
WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THUNDER, DON’T YOU GET TOO SCARED / JUST GRAB YOUR THUNDER BUDDY AND SAY THESE MAGIC WORDS: FUCK YOU THUNDER, YOU CAN EAT MY ASS / YOU CAN’T GET ME THUNDER, ‘CAUSE YOU’RE JUST GOD’S FARTS.
Lori! Hey, you’re home early! The ladies and I were just watching “Romancing the Stone.” Got it on Blu- Ray. Came in a two-pack with “Jewel of the Nile,” but I don’t know that we’ll end up watchin’ that one.
Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls. Y’know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers I wish I could thank for this great night.
Oh man, that’s what Dierdre was doin' over there in the corner for so long. Remember, she was crouched over there and I thought she was just makin' a call or somethin’--
Yeah, she’s passed out in the bathroom now, she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin’. I mean, mystery solved, I guess--
Lori, if I can-- now this is just speculation, but... is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight’s dinner not measuring up to your expectations?
Ahaaaaa!
ahaaa! That’s my friend John. Not the lobster, the guy runnin’ it.
God, there are some fucked up fish out there.
Jesus, look at that one. Mister tough guy fish. “Hey! Whatsa big idea? Cold fusion? Well that is a big idea, I beg pardon!” Look at that guy. WASP-y white guy fish. “I don’t care for some of Conan O’Brien’s humor. I don’t like Irish humor. And this food is too flavorful. I don’t care for flavor in my food.”
“Oh hey, sorry I’m late, guys. Hey, where’s everybody goin’? Any of you guys got a tissue? I’m allergic to water.”
Wh... what?
What...what did I do?
Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us.
She’s makin’ you do it, isn’t she?
What about... thunder buddies for life, Johnny?
I know you do, Johnny.
And we’ll hang out a lot, right?
Bring it over here.
I look stupid.
I look like Snuggles’ accountant. 
I don’t wanna work at a grocery store.
I told you, I can totally be a lawyer.
I’m a special case. I’m a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception ‘cause they’re all like, “Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let’s give him a job and maybe he’ll give us a few laughs,” but then they’re surprised at what a stellar performance I’m turnin’ in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case.
And if I don’t get the job will we still smoke that pot?
Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach.
Nope.
Shit.
Well, I’m a former celebrity with a minimum wage job. This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like.
Yeah, that was ah... that was a good time.
Excuse me?
Hey, I’m not an “it”, pal. I’m a “he.”
Wow. Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?
Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so far? Now it’s real. Fuck you again for that. C’mon, let’s go find a better place to get stoned.
Yeah, sure is.
Yeah. First night in my beautiful new apartment. They say they’re ain’t hardly been no murders here.
I know.
I know. I’ll be fine, Johnny.
Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries.
Hey Ellen?
Who’s that over there?
Yeah. Very cute. You know what I’d like to do to her? Somethin’ I call a Dirty Fozzie.
Okay, so that’s where we’ll draw the line.
Johnny. What are you doin’? You wanna come over and catch a buzz?
Fuck that, I traded off yesterday, so I got the night shift. C’mon, I’m bored as crap over here, just swing by for a bit.
John. Five minutes. And then I’ll kick you out, I promise. C’mon, I picked up the “Cheers” DVD box set, and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews.
Yeah, and apparently George Wendt confesses to a rape. 
They do, John. Sometimes they do.
John, I have to kick you out. I am extraordinarily busy today, I have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded. Five minutes and you’re outta here.
He is. He is. Someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become.
Here, try this stuff. I told my guy to step it up, and he gave me this.
It’s called Kennedy’s Head. It’s actually pretty mellow.
No, it’s-- it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That’s what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it up.
Yeah, it’s all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars.
There’s an Asian family next door, but they don’t have a gong or nothin’, so it’s fine.
How’s work?
Ah.
It’s actually not bad. Met a girl. She’s a bagger.
White trash name. Guess.
I know you do, and I am not fucking with you.
Tami-Lynn.
Hey, isn’t this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how’ve you been? Haven’t seen you in forever.
Company’s turnin’ 20, eh? So you can bang it but you can’t get it drunk.
Well, it’s funny, usually the first item on our agenda is “what’s goin’ on with Lori?” So I’m surprised that one slipped through the cracks. 
Right?
That was a lengthy conversation.
A canter.
No, no, that’s not what she’s sayin’ at all, right Lori?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
It’s okay, Tami. Nice, Lori. Real nice.
Baby! Baby! Baby. Baby. Let’s get outta here. We’ll go back to my place for a couple vodka and strawberry Quiks. Okay? See ya, John.
Yes. Oh. 
Kareem! You suck, Kareem.
Hello?
Gah! Uh... hi there.
Uh... no. No I’m not. I’m... you know, you’re never alone when you’re with Christ.
I’m... I’m pretty happy where I am. I just got a shitty new apartment--
Well, gosh, you know, since I just returned from active duty in the Civil War, that sounds really appealing. Oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and I don’t give a shit.
Yeah, I’m comin’, sweetheart. Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I’m gonna have to decline.
Yeah, sorry. But, ah... you know, I’d like to thank you for creepin’ up my night, and... Jesus be with you. In Christ.
Johnny! You gotta get over here, man! 
I'm havin' a little impromptu thing with some people, and John... Sam Jones is here. Sam Jones. Flash fucking Gordon. Is here.
Remember I said, my buddy’s cousin is friends with Sam Jones? My buddy’s in town with his cousin and who’s with ‘em? Sam Jones!!
Sam Jones is here, and John... his hair is parted down the middle.
Get over here.
John. There are moments in a man’s life: Nathan Hale, “I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.” Alan Hale, “Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on ‘Gilligan’s Island.’”John, this is your Alan Hale moment. For god’s sake, come share this with me.
Johnny! Thank Christ you made it!
Okay, get ready, man. Hey, Sam! This is the guy I was tellin’ you about!
John, this is Sam Jones. Sam, this is my best friend in the whole world, John.
Wow. Show us how, Flash.
Look Johnny, if we’re ever gonna get serious about openin’ a restaurant we gotta start plannin’ it now.
Italian, yes.
Eggplant parm.
And it’s a non-restricted place.
Anybody can come. Mormons are welcome.
Exactly, that’s what I’m saying.
You don’t bring it up. You just let ‘em in.
No one will.
You’re talkin’ about it, I’m just sayin’ let ‘em in.
Exactly.
Good. 
No Catholics, though.
No see, I can do this.
My teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes.
Well, you never shoulda trusted me, I’m on drugs!
Oh god, that was a fun day.
I do not sound that much like Peter Griffin.
See? There. Proof. Garfield’s eyes look like a pair of tits.
Okay, Johnny, c’mon up here and do this with me!
Come on!
See there’s this one part of the wall that’s really soft, you could punch through it wicked easy.
Ha!
We’re sorry!
Chill out okay? We’ll pay for it! Let’s talk this out okay? What’s your name? I’m John!
AAA! AAAA! OW!!
Johnny, come on upstairs. Tami-Lynn’s gonna make some RC Cola from scratch.
What?
Oh come on, she’ll go home, watch Bridget Jones’ Somethin’ Asshole, cry a little bit, she’ll be fine, you’ll talk to her tomorrow.
Well... ‘course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life.
Johnny, I’m... I’m sorry.
Johnny, wait! Hey, listen!
Johnny, it's me. 
Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna talk. 
Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you’re pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with Rex.
I’m serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.
Johnny, it’s the truth. I’m tellin’ ya--
You know, you’re actin’ like a cock, you know that?
Yes. You are actin’ like a giant, V-shaped-funny-lookin’-guy-in-a-porno cock.
‘Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cock--forget it. What I’m sayin’ is that you’re blamin’ me for somethin’ you did to yourself.
Lori was right about you. You can’t take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life.
I don’t have to, I’m a fuckin’ teddy bear! Y’know somethin’, I didn’t tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you’re supposedly my best friend.
Whoa whoa, it’s not my fault you didn’t care enough about your relationship.
Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin’ your mind? That’s your choice, John! And you know, by blamin’ me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.
Say that one more time.
C’mon, motherfucker!
Why...why are you crying? 
I’m so sorry, Johnny. I’m so sorry.
I love you.
Listen... you gotta let me help you make things right with you and Lori.
No, John, we can get her back. Look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying? Remember? And then we ran up to it and tried to give it CPR? And it came back to life? John, we could do that again.
We can get Lori back. 
Hey, play chopsticks, you jazzy slut!
Well, I’m not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I’m hangin’ in there.
Eh, ooga booga, whatever. Hey, I want you to meet a good pal of mine. Hey Johnny, come on in!
Jesus, you look fantastic.
Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at Belinda Carlisle’s house and we had awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.
I have written so many letters to Hasbro about that.
Ah, god.
Down here, I swear to god I’m not lookin’ up your towel. Not lookin’ up your towel. Not lookin’ at your funny business.
I need to talk to you.
Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you want.
Look, John loves you very much. More than anything in the world. And he’s fallin’ to fuckin’ pieces without you. He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn’t all his fault. If you’ll just give him one more chance to be with you--
Listen to me! If you’ll just give him one more chance... I promise I will leave and never come back. He’ll be all yours. Just give him one more chance.
Because of me! Look, you want him to be a man. And I’m the one who’s keepin’ that from happening. As long as he’s got his teddy bear, he’s still a boy. And I care about him as much as you do. But I’m willing to give up the boy so you can have the man.
Look, I’m givin’ this the best shot I got here, Lori. I’m beggin’ you. I’m no good at this emotional crap, but I gotta help my best friend. Please. Just talk to him.
Thank you. He’s waitin’ for me down at Charley’s. So... maybe you could, y’know... go down instead of me?
Please. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life if you don’t.
Hey, you mind if I stay and watch the Sox?
Jesus Christ, what a chick fridge. Yoplait, a cantaloupe, and a Brita water filter. Michelob Ultra Tuscan Orange Grapefruit. My god, America is imploding.
Forget your keys?
Fuck. 
Whoa...
Heh, you know what’s hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house.
I’m guessin’ you guys don’t have a PS3. I’m guessin’ you’re more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family.
Huh. Wig horse.
Y’know, you think you’re just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin’ example you’re settin’ for your kid.
Maybe “no” to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn’t hurt.
Jesus fucking Christ!
Yeah well, fuck your dad.
Shit!
That’s a great story, I felt like I was there.
Okay... okay, kid. You win. We’ll do it your way. You wanna play a game or somethin’? It’s play time, let’s play a game.
Good, good, hey, how ‘bout we play a little game of hide and seek?
Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right?
Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don’t ya think?
Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay?
You... well-- no, you-- god, that’s a weird fuckin’ question, no, just start countin’.
Okay, no peekin’, now, or you’ll get kid cancer.
John! It’s me! Can you hear me?
No, John! Don’t hang up, I’m in trouble!
They got me! That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid!
I'’m in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won’t let me outta here! They tore my ear off!
Uh... I’m not sure, it’s uh--
Shit.
Yeah, good idea.
Aaaa! AAAAAA!
Johnny!
Aaaaa! Shit!!
Back off, Susan Boyle.
Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right?
God dammit!
Johnny... Johnny...
Jesus, I look like the robot from “Aliens”.
I... I don’t think so. I’m... I’m in trouble. I need... I need to tell you something.
Don’t... don’t ever lose her again. She’s the most important... most important part of your life. Even more than me. She’s your thunder buddy now. She’s--
I’m alive, Johnny!
I’m alive! Your magical wish worked!
Yeah! I mean, when you sewed me up, you put some of the stuffing in the wrong places, so I’m a little fucked up. Will you take care of me forever and ever?
Nah, I’m just kiddin’ ya, I thought it'd be funny if you thought I was fuckin' retarded.
Son of a bitch...You wished for my life back.
You were pretty great out there at Fenway, Johnny.
Ay-- Yes! 
Y’know Sam, there’s only one way to end a perfect day.
On three.
Flash jump.
One... two... three.
YEAH!!!
